Description: An R package for deeping mining gene co-expression networks in
    multi-trait expression data. Provides functions for analyzing, comparing,
    and visualizing WGCNA networks across conditions. multiWGCNA was designed
    to handle the common case where there are multiple biologically meaningful
    sample traits, such as disease vs wildtype across development or anatomical
    region.
